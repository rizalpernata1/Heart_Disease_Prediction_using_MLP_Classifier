# Heart_Disease_Prediction_using_MLP_Classifier

This project implements a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier to predict heart disease based on various features. The dataset used in this project is preprocessed and contains information about age, gender, angina type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, ECG indicators, maximum heart rate, and exercise-induced symptoms.

The project involves splitting the data into training and testing sets, standardizing the features, training the MLP classifier, and evaluating the model's performance. Accuracy and classification reports are generated to assess the model's predictive capabilities.

The accuracy of the model is reported as 0.87, which means that the model correctly predicts the class labels for 87% of the instances in the test set.
